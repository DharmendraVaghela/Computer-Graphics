How to run:
Each part is submitted separately in the folder named part number.
Each folder has individual index.html file which can be executed directly. Javascript file is also in the folder.

Part 1 and part 2 are working properly.

For part 3:
I have tried blinn-phong to be incorporated in fragment and vertex shader but somehow it is not getting shading properly. Still shades are coming.

Part 4:
I have used the keys which are captured while taking the input from user's screen in my code. All the keys mentioned are properly incorporated.

Part 5:
In my code, the selection is not being highlighted but all the actions from the key input is applied. Please  check the actions even if the portion is not being highlighted.

References:
I have used gl-matrix file from Brandon Jones.
